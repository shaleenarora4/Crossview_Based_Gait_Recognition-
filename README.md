# Crossview Based Gait Recognition
Silhouette analysis-based gait recognition for human identification on CASIA-B dataset. The focus will be on cross view(when a subject walks at a certain angle) based gait recognition.
Stride length and height are used as features in recogniting a human.

Following gait energy images are derived from the above gei-genaration model :
